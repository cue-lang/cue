      "message": "From my p.o.v. the \"-tool\" suffix is redundant on this command nam. How about just `cue-ast` instead? FWIW I\u0027ve already renamed my version locally to `cue-ast` because `cue-ast-print` was a bit unwieldy.\n\nAlso, unless you\u0027ve got another subcommand in mind at this point I\u0027m not convinced that splitting into subcommands is worthwhile: the usage and functionality of both `print` and `join` is similar enough that I think either just a `-join` flag or just making join the default for multi-file inputs would work well.",
