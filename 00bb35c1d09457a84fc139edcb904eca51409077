      "message": "major version suffixes like these are treated especially by the toolchain - both for the standard library and for module paths. you don\u0027t `import foo \"github.com/x/foo/v3\"` for example, you just `import \"github.com/x/foo/v3\"`. tools like gopls and goimports already follow this general rule that it\u0027s OK to make assumptions about version suffixes.",
