      "message": "As discussed online, I think this should use Stat not Lstat, and I think the right check is to special-case regular files, not just named pipes and device files, because that\u0027s the way the `--force` documentation is worded (and if we allow named pipes, why not sockets too, for example). It\u0027s also less OS-specific.\n\nAlso, I don\u0027t really like the goto - it means we have to reason very carefully about whether there might be an infinite loop, whereas if we just re-invoked os.OpenFile directly, it would be very clear it\u0027s only a single retry (I\u0027m assuming here that you are only intending it to be possible for there to be a single retry!).",
