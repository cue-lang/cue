      "message": "Per my comment last night, I don\u0027t know how this can be the case. Because `cue refactor imports` works with naked `k8s.io`. Because in that situation, there is no module at all. So I think this comment needs to explain the caveat for k8s.io assuming there is one. Especially given that\u0027s a key part of what we\u0027re doing in the examples etc.",
