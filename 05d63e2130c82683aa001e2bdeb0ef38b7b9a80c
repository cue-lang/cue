      "message": "It would be nice to have doc comments on these exported methods, even if technically it is all internal. For example, it wasn\u0027t immediately clear to me what \"OneOf\" signifies here - it sounded initially like a protobuf oneof but I suspect it probably means \"is in one of the types in the SpanType mask\". If the latter is the case, wouldn\u0027t \"IsOneOf\" be a better name?",
