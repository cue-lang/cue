      "message": "LGTM with one suggestion. Also the original discussion suggested splitting out downloads from unarchived modules, so I think that\u0027s worth doing too ($CUE_CACHE_DIR/mod/download and $CUE_CACHE_DIR/mod/pkg perhaps?). I had  stupidly forgotten that you\u0027d self-assigned this, so duplicated the work in https://review.gerrithub.io/c/cue-lang/cue/+/1177060. You could maybe take the modcache changes from there.",
