      "message": "The code below cares about `diff \u003d hi - lo` values between 0 and 2. If we simply check `NumDigits() \u003e\u003d 1`, and given that `lo \u003c\u003d 0`, it could be that `hi, lo \u003d 1, 0`, and so the logic below cannot be skipped. My use of `NumDigits() \u003e 1` is so that `hi \u003e\u003d 10`, and then we know diff must be at least 10 too.\n\nAs to why exactly the code below cares about diff values between 0 and 2, I don\u0027t care too much about - here I want to quickly discard the built-in bounds, which are all start from 128, so it\u0027s not like the difference between cutting at 2 or 10 really matters :)",
