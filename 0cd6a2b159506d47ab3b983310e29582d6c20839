      "message": "Please note this is a third person\u0027s PR I already reviewed on github, so me making non-trivial changes here is a bit odd. I mainly ask for a code review from another person on the Gerrit side because I can\u0027t +2 my own CLs (even though I\u0027m not the author here) and using a bot like cueckoo for that purpose feels unnecessary - and perhaps I messed up the import to Gerrit somehow.\n\nPerfectly fine if you want to send a follow-up CL, but I\u0027d rather not touch the user\u0027s patch if we can avoid it. Maybe I wasn\u0027t clear about this being a PR that was already reviewed, but I thought it was obvious enough from the info at the top.",
