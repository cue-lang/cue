      "message": "funnily enough, upstream Go wants to quote commands as separate words, like `go` `fmt` rather than `go fmt`. You will see that sprinkled around the Go module docs and Go spec. I personally do not agree, so I\u0027m fine with this change :)",

      "message": "Oh I didn\u0027t know about that! I think it makes sense from the Go repo point of view, as they provide all of those commands / subcommands in their code base - making it clear that each part has some dedicated code to handle.\n\nFor tool dependency like this one, it is often easier to see, and copy/paste when the command is in a single code backticks - which I think you are on the same page as well :)\n\nThanks for your insight anyways though!",
