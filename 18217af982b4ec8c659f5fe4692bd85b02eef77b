      "message": "This commit message lacks information:\n\n1) Since when has this worked? We don\u0027t have to go back to ancient times, but whether or not this worked in v0.7.0 before all the modules work is a crucial piece of information.\n\n2) Note that a few users were using this as a trick to import JSON files as a package. Explain that those users should instead use the upcoming embedding support. @paul@myitcv.io already mentioned this in https://github.com/cue-lang/cue/issues/3167, and we shouldn\u0027t lose that information in the commit message.",
