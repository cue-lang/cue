      "message": "before we used a mix of ignoring the error (which could lead to weird behavior) and failing on an error. I think it\u0027s best to consistently fail on an error, with the assumption that it should be exceptionally rare.\n\nI can\u0027t even imagine a case where this would fail and continuing to run cmd/cue would be a good idea. If the current directory is somehow gone or entirely broken, finding the current CUE module or any current/relative CUE packages will fail entirely.\n\nnote that the working directory is used for more than just printing errors.",
