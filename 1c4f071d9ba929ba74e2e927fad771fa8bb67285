      "message": "Marcel is fine with adding this mode, he\u0027s just not a fan of calling the flag --files as we already have `cue import --files` as a flag, so this is a small overlap that could confuse users, given that the two flags do different things.\n\nHe\u0027s fine with `--recurse`. We talked about other flags like `--file-mode` but couldn\u0027t think of one we liked. He also suggested `cue fmt all` or `cue fmt files`, but `all` would likely collide with us supporting something like `go list all` in the future, and `files` could easily be a standard library package in the future.\n\nLet me know if you can think of a better name; if not, I think `--recurse` is fine. It\u0027s less obvious about the fact that we swap \"package mode\" for \"file mode\", but it\u0027s also much more obvious about the fact that we recurse directory trees.",

      "message": "makes sense.\n\nI thought about `cue fmt -- [FILE...]` I think it\u0027s standard for tools to treat everything that appears after -- as files, so it might make sense\n\nbut if that seems to weird, I think --recurse is good",
