      "message": "Any particular reason you chose --language.version over --language-version? CUE field/selector syntax aside, --language.version as a flag sticks out like a sore thumb next to others like --inject-vars or --with-context. As a CLI user I would expect --language-version.\n\nIf we wanted CUE selector syntax, I would expect that to be as part of a value, like\n\n    cue mod edit --set language.version\u003dv0.11.0\n\nIf you are decided on keeping the current design, at least I would explain why in the commit message.",

      "message": "Yeah, that\u0027s a reasonable point. I chose `--language.version`, as you suspect, so there\u0027s a close correspondence between flag name and selector (we refer to \"language.version\" elsewhere in the help docs etc). In the future if we had more general `--set` functionality it would be easy to make `--language.version\u003dxxx` and alias for `--set language.version\u003dxxx`, but then that\u0027s easy enough with `--language-version` too.\n\nI don\u0027t have strong feelings at all though, so happy to change to use `--language-version`.",
