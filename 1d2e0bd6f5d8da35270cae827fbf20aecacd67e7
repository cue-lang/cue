      "message": "Any particular reason you chose --language.version over --language-version? CUE field/selector syntax aside, --language.version as a flag sticks out like a sore thumb next to others like --inject-vars or --with-context. As a CLI user I would expect --language-version.\n\nIf we wanted CUE selector syntax, I would expect that to be as part of a value, like\n\n    cue mod edit --set language.version\u003dv0.11.0\n\nIf you are decided on keeping the current design, at least I would explain why in the commit message.",
