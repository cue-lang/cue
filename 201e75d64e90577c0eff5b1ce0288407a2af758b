I think we make it use the very same version, so that any changes to cue/format make us follow the new formatting consistently.\n\nThe alternative is to follow the latest stable version, but then it\u0027s an odd state where developing CUE master means you can\u0027t use the same version for `cue fmt` or the LSP to format any files.",

The LSP will not necessarily (unless explicitly triggered or taught to) be compiled against the \"current\" fmt code. Nor would `cue` that is installed on my machine, again unless explicitly re-installed.\n\nIt would also lead to awkward conflicts in the rare occasion that two CLs make `fmt`-related changes. \n\nInstead I would suggest pinning to a released version of CUE that developers in this repo should use.

      "message": "Hmm. I think there are pros and cons both ways.\n\nPros of following a pinned version:\n* Less chance of conflicts due to the diff noise of any formatting changes (though they should be rare)\n* Easier for anyone not re-running `go install ./cmd/cue` on master continuously\n\nPros of following master always:\n* Any formatting changes are \"dogfooded\" immediately, although we could do this by bumping the pinned version with alphas\n* No need to remember what version we are currently pinning, although we could solve this with e.g. `cue cmd check` or `cue cmd format` at the top level, to be used by both humans and CI\n\nI think I lean towards a pinned version now, like you say. As long as we bump the pinned version with alphas and provide a `cue cmd` so we all format the same way easily. I will take another stab at this CL.",
