      "message": "how about\n\n\u003e with some changes to better fit CUE syntax as \"$\" and \"@\" are special characters.\n\nthis gives a direct hint without the user needing to read the full proposal, and it\u0027s also a bit more precise - because we _could_ represent fields called `@foo` or `$` in CUE, so it\u0027s not a compatibility issue. It\u0027s just that the quoting would lead to bad UX, so I think \"better fit\" is clearer.",

      "message": "The proposal is a github discussion that serves a purpose for some time, but afterwards is frozen and effectively archived. As the koala encoding evolves over time, we will update the code and documentation tracked in git here, but not necessarily the older proposal.\n\nSo I think the docs here need to stand on their own in terms of summarizing the encoding\u0027s design. It\u0027s fine to reference the proposal, but only as an extra for historical context, not as a replacement for describing the encoding.\n\nWe don\u0027t have to go overboard in describing every detail of the encoding here either, which is why I suggested one sentence for now. Most users won\u0027t need that much detail. But I\u0027m also fine with expanding the godoc with more details if you prefer.",
