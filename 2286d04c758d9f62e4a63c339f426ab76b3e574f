      "message": "see the next commit, which standardizes the \"is directory\" inconsistency :) indeed stat vs lstat is another one. I\u0027ll let Claude have a go at that one once this stack is merged. no need to block the alpha for it methinks.\n\nat least with stat vs lstat, I think the difference is almost zero as long as we don\u0027t care about \"is directory\", because then the only difference would be symlinks which point to a missing file, as stat would fail on those but lstat would not. so I don\u0027t think any end users would see a noticeable change in behavior.",
