      "message": "personally I\u0027m a fan of this, e.g. the new `net/netip` instead of `net/ip`, or `net/http/httptest` rather than `net/http/test`.\n\nFYI an alternative would be to keep the directory as `mod/zip` but name the package like `package modzip`. not perfect since there is a naming inconsistency, but it\u0027s a middle ground that avoids the longer path while also avoiding taking up the name \"zip\". I\u0027ve seen it with SDK packages, e.g. `api/foo/v1` accompanied by `package foov1`.\n\nI\u0027d still go with what you did here, but just sharing another option.",
