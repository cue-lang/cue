      "message": "I briefly thought about this, but personally for one added line I wouldn\u0027t bother. The diff is likely to mean more lines added in the end. If anything, this could be a generic \"must\" test helper func that works with any call returning `(T, error)`, as this verbosity has nothing to do with txtar per se. We have added a few such funcs in the past, but nothing widespread, as there\u0027s no such pattern in Go (yet), and quicktest has been OK for now.\n\nThere\u0027s another reason to keep the `qt.Assert` separate and explicit - one can add comments depending on the context of each test or func: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-quicktest/qt#Commentf\n\nPerhaps @rogpeppe@gmail.com has thoughts.",

      "message": "Yeah I see your point - looking at the code surrounding the callsites, a Must would stand out unless you convert, well, everything. Sigh - Go needs an error monad.\n\nAside: I assumed the Commentf stuff was going to be normal code comments in the style of https://github.com/matryer/is, which is cute, but I think is actively harmful to abstraction/refactoring. Currently, across the whole of CUE, there are 8 uses of Commentf, and several hundred of Assert so that feature doesn\u0027t seem especially critical, but that\u0027s not by itself reason to make using it harder.",

The current approach works, but it is a bit repetitive and verbose. I still think more proposals are coming from upstream.
