      "message": "Apologies - I missed this in my earlier review, and it only came up as I was updating cuelang.org\u0027s help text generation to be compatible:\n\nRight now, `cue help help` shows help text about *using* the `cue help` command. Sure, it\u0027s not complicated, but the output includes:\n\n```\nUsage:\n  cue help [command] [flags]\n```\n\n... which is instructional information not directly included anywhere else, as far as I can see.\n\nIf `cue help help` goes away, we won\u0027t have a CLI-related page on cuelang.org that includes this info. Unless we hard code the exception of `cue help --help`, which will still be available (but pretty hidden), I guess?",
