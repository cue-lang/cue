      "message": "nit: my personal preference would be to use `!\u003d` rather than `\u003e` . Having spent 5 mins reading and thinking about `vertexStatus`, it does look like they are ordered, so I can understand using `\u003e` . But, I can\u0027t find any `status++` or similar - it always seems to be `Vertex.updateStatus(some constant literal)`. So, I would prefer `!\u003d`, and then it\u0027s robust to reordering of the consts (and I think the rest of the code is too).",

      "message": "I\u0027m not sure I agree. This catches negative v.status values (the type is int8), which your code wouldn\u0027t. So either method catches a form of edge case - I don\u0027t think either is particularly superior. I lean towards leaving as is given that I only wanted to clarify the constants.",
