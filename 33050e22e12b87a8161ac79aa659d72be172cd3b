      "message": "For --diff I agree, particularly to mirror Go\u0027s `gofmt -d`.\n\nFor --check I\u0027m less sure. It\u0027s a flag that will be generally useful in other cases as well, for example we already have `cue mod tidy --check`. And upstream Go is also adding `go mod tidy -check` and `gofmt -check` with all likelihood (single dashes as they don\u0027t use GNU flags, but still the same flag name).\n\nAnd, because it\u0027s a flag that we will use in many places, I\u0027m nervous about taking over -c as a short flag. It\u0027s already taken elsewhere, for example `cue vet` and `cue eval` have `-c` as short for `--concrete`. We might not think that those commands will need a `--check` flag today, but who knows - and having the same short flag mean different stuff in different commands is something I\u0027d like to avoid if possible.\n\nAll in all I _think_ --check will mainly be used in CI and scripts, so I think it\u0027s OK to not have a short-hand.",
