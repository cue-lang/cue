      "message": "Maybe this gets improved later on in this CL chain, but:\nIt\u0027s really unclear to me when it\u0027s correct to use the `status` field and when to use the `Status()` method. There are no docs or guidance on either, and although the difference is very small, I can imagine it\u0027s easy to get tripped up and use the wrong one. I wonder whether renaming the method to `DerefStatus()` or something like that might help?",

      "message": "One should always use Status(), at least for evalv3. Added a comment to the method, also explaining this:\n\nNote that I did not change the V2 version of evaluator. This would just cause more churn through rebase errors, and since we are deleting that code anyway, it is wasted cycles.",
