      "message": "Maybe this gets improved later on in this CL chain, but:\nIt\u0027s really unclear to me when it\u0027s correct to use the `status` field and when to use the `Status()` method. There are no docs or guidance on either, and although the difference is very small, I can imagine it\u0027s easy to get tripped up and use the wrong one. I wonder whether renaming the method to `DerefStatus()` or something like that might help?",
