I think \"cue\" has to be there, and I\u0027d like to keep \"types\" in there too, because in the future we may want to support generating Go code (not types!) for e.g. validators of schema constraints.\n\nThat\u0027s also why I went with `cue exp gengotypes` rather than `cue exp gengo` or somesuch, to clarify that the tool is exclusively about types.\n\nso if you are suggesting `cue_gen_%s.go`, that loses the property above. And `cue_gen_types_%s.go` gets rather lengthy already.",
