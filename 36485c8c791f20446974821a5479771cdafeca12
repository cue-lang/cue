      "message": "if this is just about per-file experiments, I\u0027d perhaps suggest `file-experiments` or `attr-experiments` to clarify that this is entirely separate from the global env var experiments under CUE_EXPERIMENT.\n\nMy personal choice would be for `cue help experiments` to document _both_ global and per-file experiments as two separate sections. Then we can keep the documentation for all experiments in one place, without splitting it between `cue help environment` and `cue help file-experiments`.",
