I think this is a potential fix for the regression that came up which results in both tests passing. \n\nThat being said, I am not very familiar with the evaluator and this required a minor change there - so I\u0027m not sure if there\u0027s a better approach here. Let me know if there\u0027s any issues.",

      "message": "I\u0027m sorry, I\u0027m not sure if this is done per se :) I see in PS2 you removed some changes, but PS3 re-added them. What I mean is two commits, where the first one changes the evaluator, and the second one changes tools/flow. Two commits with two different change-id git trailers should result in a stack of two Gerrit changes in a chain.\n\nFor example, see the stack of two commits I had here: https://review.gerrithub.io/c/cue-lang/cue/+/1185684",
