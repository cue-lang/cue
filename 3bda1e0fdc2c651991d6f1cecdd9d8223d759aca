      "message": "FYI Marcel, as discussed.\n\nAn alternative would be to declare these two fields in the cmd package rather than the adt package. That would be a bit cleaner, since the adt package does not use the fields at all, but also more verbose and perhaps confusing due to the duplication:\n\n```\npackage cmd\n\ntype Stats struct {\n    ADT adt.Stats\n    \n    Runtime struct {\n        AllocBytes uint64\n        AllocObjects uint64\n    }\n}\n```\n\nor, if we wanted to keep the stats format flat, we could consider embedding, though then it\u0027s not clear what stats are coming from where:\n\n```\npackage cmd\n\ntype Stats struct {\n    adt.Stats\n    \n    AllocBytes uint64\n    AllocObjects uint64\n}\n```",
