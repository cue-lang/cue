      "message": "I\u0027ve started the chain of changes. There\u0027s a new base commit which introduces a benchmark, then this commit has the benchmark comparison, then a third commit bumps the precision and compares the benchmark numbers against the first two.\n\nOverall there\u0027s little change. I think this is because we convert to math/big ints quite often, so the apd/v3 benefit of avoiding allocations by not using math/big directly is less effective. We could likely do better via follow-up changes if we wanted to.\n\nOverall I\u0027m not too worried about a performance benefit, as long as we don\u0027t regress noticeably. I just want to move on from apd/v2 as it\u0027s effectively dead :)",
