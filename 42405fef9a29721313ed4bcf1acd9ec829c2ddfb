I also didn\u0027t clearly see why we needed to separate the two, other than one of them being a subset of the other\u0027s fields.\n\nAll the other simplifications and cleanups SGTM, minus the removal of Stream, because I really want to use it sooner than later. If you add the TODO as suggested above, I can send a patch later this week to start using it. I think the existing true/false values for it are correct.",
