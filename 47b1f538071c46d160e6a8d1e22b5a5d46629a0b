      "message": "How about `base`, e.g. `base.#earlyChecks`? I think the term \"base\" is slightly more appropriate, as downstreams are meant to build upon these definitions. And `core` strikes me as too generic, like `common` or `util`.\n\nAnother one that might also work nicely is \"standard\", e.g. `standard.#earlyChecks`, though it\u0027s longer.",
