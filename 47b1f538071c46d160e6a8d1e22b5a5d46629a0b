      "message": "How about `base`, e.g. `base.#earlyChecks`? I think the term \"base\" is slightly more appropriate, as downstreams are meant to build upon these definitions. And `core` strikes me as too generic, like `common` or `util`.\n\nAnother one that might also work nicely is \"standard\", e.g. `standard.#earlyChecks`, though it\u0027s longer.",

This would immediately be caught, because we would not be able to generate Yaml output. As such I\u0027m not too worried about this. \n\nWe could of course rename the import so the package value is name something else more obscure, and then adopt `core` as the local field name. Happy to revisit this in a later CL because it\u0027s not critical.\n\nAdded a TODO.",
