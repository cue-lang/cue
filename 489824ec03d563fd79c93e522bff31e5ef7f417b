      "message": "As you\u0027re making general improvements here, using `make` with `len(list)` would likely be wise here too? Oh, also shouldn\u0027t `list` be renamed (`iter`?) given it\u0027s no longer a list. Took me a couple moments to figure out why ranges had changed from `_, c :\u003d`  to `c :\u003d` ... ah yes, it\u0027s not a list any more.",

Personally, I\u0027m not convinced the switch to iters is worth it given using `Count` is O(n), and especially seeing as we tend to be careful about memory allocations, so having to use `Count` in combination with `make` is a step backwards I think vs `len`.",
