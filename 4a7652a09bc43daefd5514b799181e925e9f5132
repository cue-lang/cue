      "message": "Noting per my offline comment that the changes originally made here move us from a state of reporting no errors to some. The decision to not fatal all errors was something of a defensive measure in the event of concurrently editing Go and CUE files locally. Which is arguably a situation that takes lower priority vs correctness of behaviour with respect to Go files which are considered \"done\". So very happy with this change.",
