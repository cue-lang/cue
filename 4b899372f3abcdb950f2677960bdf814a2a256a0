I find it makes it much harder to read as part of any non-trivial condition. Maybe a different name would solve this (rather than inverting a bunch of logic) - possibly \"anonymous\" instead of \"notAddressable\", but I can\u0027t think of a suitable alternative for \"nonRooted\".",

So inverting them would not be ideal.\n\nMaybe an alternative would be to have accessor methods that are used instead of the fields that invert the conditions. So Rooted() { return !nonRooted }. I do that in some cases already I believe.\n\nI like anonymous, though. Changed.",
