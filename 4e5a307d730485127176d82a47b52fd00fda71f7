But I do think that removing unused code helps everyone. It makes the module zips smaller for users, and allows us to understand and refactor the codebase with slightly fewer distractions.",

This is a bit big to consider at once and it doesn\u0027t seem to be high priority.\n\nFWIW my thought was that this is all mechanical as pointed out by staticcheck, and fairly clearly can\u0027t affect any public facing APIs, so even if it does affect disparate parts of the code, it would seem OK to do, and even though not strictly high priority, it\u0027s very low risk and makes understanding and refactoring the code easier, which I think is a reasonably high priority.",
