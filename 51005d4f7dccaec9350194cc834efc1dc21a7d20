But if so, I would have thought you meant \"preceding\" rather than \"subsequent\"?\nAlso I don\u0027t think I understand why it\u0027s safe to test only the last parameter, and none of the others.",

      "message": "The number of arguments may be less then the number of parameters if the parameters have a default value. If the n-th parameter has a default, then all subsequent parameters have a default as well. So it is sufficient to test this.\n\nSo I meant subsequent. The first arguments are already given, all parameters from position numArgs and onwards must have a default as well for this to work.\n\nNote that the call method still appends all default values.",
