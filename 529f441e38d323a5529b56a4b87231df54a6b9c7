      "message": "Because the scanner is very simple, and it parses `::` as two separate colon tokens. This is how Marcel left it when removing support for `::`:\n\nhttps://review.gerrithub.io/c/cue-lang/cue/+/546886\n\nWe generally rely on the parser to detect this as a syntax error. This test just checks that we can tokenize the entire stream without seeing any comments, so it doesn\u0027t use the parser to detect syntax errors.\n\nMaybe the scanner should be more helpful and reject old tokens, but I also don\u0027t think that is the biggest deal given that almost no users should be directly using the scanner this way.\n\nI\u0027ve added a summary in the commit message.",
