      "message": "Needs a doc comment, and I\u0027m also not clear on the naming. This method is `(*modfile.File).Versions()`. Which sort of suggests at first (and to me subsequent) reading that this gives me versions of a module file? I\u0027m not clear what that would even be. Instead, this method is actually returning the versions of dependencies. That should probably be clearer in the naming?",

So I\u0027m unclear why you even need this embedded version, save for adding the constraint `unimplemented`.

This is an adjunct that makes it easy to see in one place what\u0027s still to do. I wouldn\u0027t publish the schema like this, but I _think_ it makes for a reasonable WIP.
