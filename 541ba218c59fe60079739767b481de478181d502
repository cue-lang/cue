      "message": "Yes, because the Go compiler does not assume that it can \"join\" allocations in general, like with your snippet. Only if you force it (by e.g. allocating everything under a single struct) does it do that.\n\nWhich makes sense, because joining allocations in general could lead to holding onto too much memory at times.\n\nThis is not a pattern I use all the time. Only for very hot functions which allocate groups of objects which share the same lifetime.",
