      "message": "my intuition is that you should use `os.Lstat` here rather than `ListFiles` - you just want to check if the file exists on disk, and then call VCS\u0027s Status method to check that the file is tracked and committed. if there\u0027s a very good reason to use ListFiles, perhaps document it, as it\u0027s not obvious to me at least.\n\nor, even more than that, I would imagine that calling just Status would be enough. the only bit of info that Status doesn\u0027t say is whether LICENSE is a regular file, because if it\u0027s a directory with many files, we supposedly want to ignore it. So perhaps for that reason `os.Lstat` is still necessary.",

      "message": "this doc is out of date now.\n\nIt\u0027s a bit unfortunate to have one map entry per file - in the vast majority of cases, i.e. all except a parent LICENSE file, the old absPath logic was fine. perhaps the map can just be used as an \"absPathOverlay\" with either 0 or 1 entries in practice? and you can document it\u0027s needed for files being published from outside modRoot.",
