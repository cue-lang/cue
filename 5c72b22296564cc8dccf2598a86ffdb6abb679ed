      "message": "I agree that the loop is unnecessary in practice, but the alternative is two if blocks with almost exactly the same body, so that seemed slightly worse.\n\nI do find the existing version a bit inconsistent and hard to understand - it mixes Indirect with Elem, and it mixes IsValid with IsNil. From reading the reflect docs, I find it easier to prove to myself what the new code does.",
