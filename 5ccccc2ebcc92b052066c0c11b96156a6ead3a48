      "message": "I started by trying to make a more generic codegen/export version of https://review.gerrithub.io/c/cue-lang/cue/+/1192184, and got myself tangled up with test failures.\n\nThen I started trying to refactor the CUE so that I could actually comprehend what was going on. The first thing I did was get rid of the unification with the top level value, and... it was already really fast? This surprised me, but I guess such huge unifications aren\u0027t a good idea.\n\nI thought to myself that we should check this in first, and only consider codegen with shortcuts as an incremental step _if_ it still helps considerably enough.",
