      "message": "FYI Noam, since Marcel is travelling for a week starting tomorrow, and we are doing v0.9.0-rc.1 next week, we think we should delay this relatively risky change until we have done the final release for v0.9.0 and begin work for v0.10 - probably in 2-3 weeks.\n\nRisky changes like these need a few weeks of alpha testing to make sure we\u0027re not introducing a big regression, so it\u0027s best to play it safe. Hopefully that makes sense!",
