      "message": "FYI Noam, since Marcel is travelling for a week starting tomorrow, and we are doing v0.9.0-rc.1 next week, we think we should delay this relatively risky change until we have done the final release for v0.9.0 and begin work for v0.10 - probably in 2-3 weeks.\n\nRisky changes like these need a few weeks of alpha testing to make sure we\u0027re not introducing a big regression, so it\u0027s best to play it safe. Hopefully that makes sense!",

But it\u0027s of course also fine if you want to delay until the release happens, there\u0027s no rush.",
