If the intention is to make the field unifiable with `float`, this could be written as `18446744073709551616.0` or maybe `18446744073709551616 + .0` if we wanted to keep the original literal token as close as possible.\n\nIt might also be nice to have a sanity check that all the CUE can be evaluated without errors, which would catch this issue.",
