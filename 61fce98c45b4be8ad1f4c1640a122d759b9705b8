      "message": "yeah. I actually initially thought it was the opposite way because I forgot. but just following the existing design by Marcel here :) \n\n\nFWIW my initial logic was like currying in Haskell, where you can take a func that accepts (A, B), pass it A, and you get a func that takes (B).\n\nBut I think Marcel designed this like the validator always omits one argument, and it\u0027s the first as the \"receiver\" of the validator expression/constraint. So perhaps this is more Go-like and doesn\u0027t give the impression that we support Haskell-like currying.",

      "message": "fwiw, and it may not be much, personally I\u0027d have called that a mask, not a prefix. Even though I know it\u0027s closer to a prefix in operation. I just am more used to seeing them referred to as netmasks.\n\nEDIT: I\u0027ve never seen net/netip before. Curious that net has ParseCIDR and netip has ParsePrefix. I guess cidr is the best name but that\u0027s already taken here, and given the underlying stdlib, prefix probably is the next best. As you were 😉",
