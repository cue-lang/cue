      "message": "fwiw, and it may not be much, personally I\u0027d have called that a mask, not a prefix. Even though I know it\u0027s closer to a prefix in operation. I just am more used to seeing them referred to as netmasks.\n\nEDIT: I\u0027ve never seen net/netip before. Curious that net has ParseCIDR and netip has ParsePrefix. I guess cidr is the best name but that\u0027s already taken here, and given the underlying stdlib, prefix probably is the next best. As you were 😉",
