If not, what bug is this fixing?\n\nI have had a fix at https://review.gerrithub.io/c/cue-lang/cue/+/1196134 for a few days, so it\u0027s slightly unfortunate timing. Note that I had to be careful to adjust the rest of the repository to update all formatted/generated CUE code without any regressions, though.\n\nI would suggest we continue with that patch given that it\u0027s more complete, unless you think your solution is the better approach. From a quick look, both solutions seem reasonable to me.",
