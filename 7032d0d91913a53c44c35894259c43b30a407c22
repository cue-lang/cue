      "message": "I came up with \"printable\" in the last CL to mean \"it can be shown to the user as a position\", i.e. it is a valid position that\u0027s more than just a relative position. I.e. it is attached to a file (which could have an empty filename!) and so it has some sort of offset+line+column information.\n\nIn other words, printable \u003d\u003d String returns something useful.\n\nI\u0027m happy to consider alternatives, or to document \"printable\" better, if you have suggestions.",
