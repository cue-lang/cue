      "message": "This is probably a slightly academic concern, but still:\n\nThere is no guarantee that the transform does no internal buffering. Consequently, the act of creating the transform reader (line 197) could have read something from the underlying buffer `srcr`. We are therefore not guaranteed that this `io.Readall(srcr)` actually does read everything.\n\nThe `t` and `r` are created a block too early - they could be moved down to ~line 226. Which also then means you could a test for this `build.Binary` case early, before `r` (and `t`) is created, and then we\u0027d have the guarantee.\n\nThis is probably nothing to worry about, but if it were me, I think I would make this change, to make the code a touch more defensive.",

      "message": "Agreed. Although it\u0027s trivial to manually verify that transform.NewReader does nothing other than allocate, it\u0027s logically nicer (and a tiny bit cheaper) to do the binary check first before creating the transformer.",
