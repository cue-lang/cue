The CUE is longer, but it\u0027s more structured and has more of a pattern to it.\n\nI had already thought that the old form wasn\u0027t particularly nice; global numbering and mixing different APIs didn\u0027t feel right. An alternative would be to split up the file into more files, but that also has its drawbacks, so I like this better.\n\nDid you forget to run the trybots on this chain, btw?",
