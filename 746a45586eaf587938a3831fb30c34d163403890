      "message": "Agreed. Very annoyingly I had already commented on this fact but it was left as a draft:\n\n\u003e My guess is that we have a whitespace change in this file because listcommands is used as part of the computation of \"how much width do we need for the first column\" even though it is not rendered because it is a hidden command.",

      "message": "The minimal output that I believe would be able to supplement the current cuelang.org page generation includes a list of the exact commands that generate help texts, omitting internal commands.\n\n`cue listcommands`, at least, is internal, and would need not to appear in this list.\n\n`cue help vet` would need to appear in this list instead of `cue vet` to prevent cuelang.org\u0027s generation having to distinguish (for example) between `cue help commands` and `cue vet`, in order to only inject the `help ` string at $1 inside the `cue vet` command string.\n\nWe can, of course, work round any of these issues by having more code on the cuelang.org side of the fence, or by changing what/how cuelang.org presents the commands. I mention these issues based on the headline aim of this change to remove code/data/complexity from cuelang.org.",
