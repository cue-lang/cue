      "message": "The minimal output that I believe would be able to supplement the current cuelang.org page generation includes a list of the exact commands that generate help texts, omitting internal commands.\n\n`cue listcommands`, at least, is internal, and would need not to appear in this list.\n\n`cue help vet` would need to appear in this list instead of `cue vet` to prevent cuelang.org\u0027s generation having to distinguish (for example) between `cue help commands` and `cue vet`, in order to only inject the `help ` string at $1 inside the `cue vet` command string.\n\nWe can, of course, work round any of these issues by having more code on the cuelang.org side of the fence, or by changing what/how cuelang.org presents the commands. I mention these issues based on the headline aim of this change to remove code/data/complexity from cuelang.org.",
