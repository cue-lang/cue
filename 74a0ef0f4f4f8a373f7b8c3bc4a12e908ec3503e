      "message": "Patterns are explored in isolation from other conjuncts/arcs (see roughly line 657 in this file). As such, they are simplified, but they are considered no different to any other field of a vertex. Therefore, if there\u0027s a tie between a conjunct from a pattern, and a conjunct from outside a pattern, the pattern will always win, because it is known that the pattern\u0027s conjunct must be kept, otherwise the pattern itself is being made less specific.",
