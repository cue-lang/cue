      "message": "Making more changes to third_party/yaml is not ideal, but I\u0027m not entirely opposed to it if it is the simplest solution. As long as we have a regression test, we can be sure we don\u0027t reintroduce the bug in the future.\n\nThat said, this doesn\u0027t seem like an entirely right fix; see the comments below. Is it possible that you also need to tweak how the yaml decoder positions advance line numbers?",

      "message": "add a brief comment at the top of this testscript to summarize why we added this test, like:\n\n```\n# Importing YAML with multi-byte characters as CUE resulted in bad formatting\n# since the YAML decoder would count columns by characters and we count by bytes.\n```\n\nparticularly important since we\u0027ll want to either update or replace third_party/yaml at some point, so any changes made there like your fix will need to be retraced - so looking at this test and seeing a reminder will help.",
