This is the only incorrect use of `-p` that I can find on cuelang.org that comes directly from cmd/cue\u0027s help texts.\n\ncf. https://github.com/cue-lang/cue/issues/3516#issuecomment-2575575847 for the latest user who (I suspect) saw this text and imprinted on \"-p influences which CUE package to evaluate\". I know that I was tripped up by this, early in my CUE learning!",
