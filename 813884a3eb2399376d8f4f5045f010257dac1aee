      "message": "At some point we should come up with some more convenient test framework. Ideally some `cue test` implementation that we could use for CUE itself as well.\n\nOne idea is to take the approach Rog was taking for jsonschema, to not include the diff, but mark a test as not passing for a specific version. The diffs can also be helpful to see what is going on, though. So far they have been useful. But we could, for instance, only show diffs for failing tests.",
