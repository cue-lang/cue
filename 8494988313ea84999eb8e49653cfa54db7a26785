      "message": "Thanks for your patience.\n\nOne more caveat. We are starting to use \"match\" very specifically to mean unification of a schema against a finalized value (one where defaults are \"expanded\"). The issue with doing plain unification is that it could be that a value that is ultimately exported is actually NOT compatible with the matched schema.\n\nThis code probably doesn\u0027t handle that. However, it probably makes more sense that any non-schema arguments to functions are finalized. The Value method makes an attempt at that, but I don\u0027t think the List method does. Either way, this should probably not be handled in this function.\n\nConsidering that this is either way a pretty pathological edge case, I suggest we just check it in. Just beware that this may be an issue and that we will likely change the semantics.",
