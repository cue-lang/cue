      "message": "Looks great overall.\n\nI\u0027m a bit confused as to where the additional empty wrapped error when printing comes from. It may make sense to factor this into two CLs: one with the refactorings and one with the actual changes. At first glance I don\u0027t see any change that could cause this.\n\nThe affected tests can be run as `go test ./pkg/...`",

      "message": "The underlying reason was the fix to `Promote` to make it correctly use `%s` instead of passing the error string directly as the format argument to `Wrapf`.\n\nThat change meant that the logic inside `writeErr` to detect whether an error message was empty no longer worked, because it only looked at `msg`, not at the end result of the sprintf.\n\nI\u0027ve fixed it to do the sprintf first before checking for empty. That\u0027s more correct, although marginally slower.",
