      "message": "presumably you mean noncrete values here, as an incomplete value (a value which is an incomplete error) is almost certainly a mistake AFAICS?\n\nAlso, we _do_ already allow noncrete values when decoding into `cue.Value`. I\u0027m not entirely sure what this TODO would actually do tbh. Perhaps explain a bit more here about what allowing noncrete or incomplete values might imply?",

It\u0027s been there since the very early days of decode.go, so I\u0027d rather leave it as-is and we can discuss with Marcel in the future when we want to tackle this.",
