Indeed perhaps that\u0027s what we saw with the massive error stacks in unity (both vector and cascaad have this aspect oriented approach to conditionally adding fields).\n\nHowever, I can see being able to explore these locations being something the user would want to do via the LSP command of some sort.\n\nSubject to the point above about the missing line referencing the declaration of p, perhaps we just leave this for now and solve more for better grouping etc of error messages down the line.",
