      "message": "cosmetic:\nI would definitely be tempted to rename these to be more explicit, e.g. `hasCycle` \u003d\u003e `hasAnyCyclicConjunct` and similar for the other fields.\nThe reason is in the use sites (e.g. assertStructuralCycleV3) I find it rather confusing to see both `n.hasCycle` and `n.hasNonCycle` - with more explicit names it is more immediately obvious why one isn\u0027t the negation of the other.\n\nI would also be tempted to add some helper methods such as `hasOnlyCyclicConjunctions` which I think would make `assertStructuralCycleV3` more readable as the final `if` there becomes `if n.hasOnlyCyclicConjuncts() {...`",
