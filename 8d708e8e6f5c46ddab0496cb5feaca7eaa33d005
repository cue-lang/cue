It\u0027s the same as in normal cue files/packages searching for usages / references of a given field - there\u0027s nothing you can do to avoid just loading everything in the current module to figure out what imports what and so how far you have to search+evaluate to figure out usages.\n\nIt\u0027s not super expensive - you have the IO for reading the files, and you have to parse it to get the AST, but that is about it.",
