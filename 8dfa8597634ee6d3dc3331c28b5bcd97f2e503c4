      "message": "sorry, I\u0027m not sure how I missed this - this behavior change is incorrect. When using a `json.RawMessage`, and the input being `null`, it should end up as `json.RawMessage(\"null\")` rather than `nil`. The whole point of `json.RawMessage` (or any other `json.Unmarshaler` for that fact) is that it can do whatever it wants with the input JSON, even if it\u0027s null.\n\nI suspect this is because you\u0027ve moved the unmarshaler calls after the null pointer check, which doesn\u0027t seem right.",
