      "message": "Hmm. So `fmt.Fprintf` does return errors, and here we\u0027re throwing them away. Personally I\u0027d prefer if we were robust about this - this is no longer throw-away code if it\u0027s going to be used via CI, so I think errors should not be lost.\nBut, if we really are happy with them being ignored, then a comment or two documenting this seems wise.",

      "message": "I realise this is mainly just a moving of code, and this suggestion is 100% personal-taste-cosmetic, so a nit at most: when the case blocks get long like they are in this switch, I find it\u0027s nice to have a blank line before each new `case` line.\n\nI\u0027ve also never seen `default` appear anywhere other than at the end - I just went to the language spec to check that it doesn\u0027t do weird things.
