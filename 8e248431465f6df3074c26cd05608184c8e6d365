      "message": "Hmm. So `fmt.Fprintf` does return errors, and here we\u0027re throwing them away. Personally I\u0027d prefer if we were robust about this - this is no longer throw-away code if it\u0027s going to be used via CI, so I think errors should not be lost.\nBut, if we really are happy with them being ignored, then a comment or two documenting this seems wise.",

      "message": "I tend to agree with you in principle. However, since this is an internal API that is really only used with buffers or stdout/stderr right now, the errors really don\u0027t matter at all for now. Adding error handling would be adding a good number of lines of code for little benefit.\n\nIf I were pressed to deal with the errors, I would probably rewrite this API to be append-like, such as `func AppendDebug(dst []byte, node ast.Node) []byte`, since `append` never fails, unlike `io.Writer.Write`. There\u0027s no particular reason why I avoided that here, I think just out of habit. Since it\u0027s an internal API, we can change it like that whenever we like.\n\nI\u0027ve added a note to the godoc as you suggest.",

      "message": "Sure, I\u0027ll add the empty lines. I agree they can help, I had them in the other switch but not here. I would prefer to keep this as a \"just move code\" change, but I also don\u0027t feel like it\u0027s a significant enough change to mean another commit.\n\nDefault cases can be anywhere indeed, the only behavior that is affected by the order of switch cases is `fallthrough`. There is a general consensus to leave `default` as either the last case (most common) or the first case though, for the sake of readability. I\u0027m personally happy with either - I tend to use it as the last case when it\u0027s the error case or the most complex case, and I tend to use it as the first when it\u0027s the easy or \"base\" case, like here.",
