      "message": "I was trying to provoke the NoLogExactf expectation to fail, but the test was unexpectedly passing. It became clear to me that I needed to add a number of these \"DoneWith...\" calls otherwise the expectations were being met far too quickly - essentially racing with the LSP server. The \"DoneWith...\" calls make the (fake)client/editor wait for processing to be finished, at which point the negative expectations actually make sense (and in this case, the NoLogExactf would fail without this fix).",
