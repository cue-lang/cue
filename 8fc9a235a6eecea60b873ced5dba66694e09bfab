      "message": "Correct. This is an expected failure. I guess we have to live with this to get v0.5 out of the door, because we just don\u0027t have the new golden files system ready. We knew it would be a problem for chains of CLs, but I don\u0027t think we had considered the problem of release branches.\n\nWhat I propose is that we do any changes to v0.5 we need while ignoring Unity, and I can manually run Unity with the slightly older corpus right before we do the v0.5 release.",
