I added one for cmd/cue (which actually found an issue) but not one for cue/load, as there didn\u0027t seem a good place for doing it (there don\u0027t seem to be any similar tests in cue/load), and cmd/cue is a fairly thin layer over cue/load, so I think the cmd/cue test should give us sufficient confidence here.",
