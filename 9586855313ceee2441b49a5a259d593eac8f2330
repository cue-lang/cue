      "message": "Using Unix mode when we might be on Windows seems a bit awkward to me.\nThe `\\` character should count as a separator on Windows, not an escape character.\nThis means that a pattern with a trailing separator character will be considered invalid under Windows, which seems wrong.\n\nWhy not just use the current OS to do the check? After all, in Windows `x\\**` _should_ be forbidden, because at a later date that will probably be mean \"all files recursively under `x`.",
