The only difference is the prefix to be matched and the error message, but those can be variables in a two-element loop, for instance.\n\nSpeaking of, this second error is wrong, right? The first error says `\u0027.\u0027`, but the second one says `\u0027_`, missing the closing quote. We could avoid that problem by using `%q`.",
