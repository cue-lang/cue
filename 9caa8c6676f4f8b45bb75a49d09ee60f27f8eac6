      "message": "I think the better solution would be to set the package name in the ast.File and let cue/format deal with the printing and good formatting of the package declaration. you can do a copy of https://github.com/cue-lang/cue/blob/723438a57754/cue/ast/ast.go#L1005 for instance - arguably we could have a Package method that returns a pointer for convenience.\n\non one hand this is to encapsulate syntax printing in one package, but especially since cue/format ensures good formatting, e.g. not too many empty lines.",
