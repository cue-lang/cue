      "message": "I\u0027m a bit concerned about defensiveness here. Clearly `x` cannot be nil. But this method allows `from` and `to` to be nil. I think the intention is that either they must both be nil, or neither must be nil (i.e. `(from \u003d\u003d nil) \u003d\u003d (to \u003d\u003d nil)`) but there\u0027s no checking of this. I would find it helpful it the code was more explicit about what\u0027s expected and allowed, and what\u0027s not.",
