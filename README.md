# CUE - _Configure, Unify, Execute_

CUE makes it easy to validate data, write schemas,
and ensure configurations align with policies.

CUE works with a wide range of tools and formats that you're already using
such as Go, JSON, YAML, OpenAPI, and JSON Schema.

For more information and documentation, including __tutorials and guides__, see [cuelang.org](https://cuelang.org).

### Download and Install

The full range of installation methods for the `cue` command are listed on the
[cuelang.org site](https://cuelang.org/docs/introduction/installation/),
including the official container image suitable for use with Docker.
Here are two common ways to install the command:

#### Release builds

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/cue-lang/cue/releases/latest/) from GitHub.

#### Install from Source

You need [Go 1.22 or later](https://go.dev/doc/install) to install CUE from source:

	go install cuelang.org/go/cmd/cue@latest

You can also clone the repository and build it directly via `go install ./cmd/cue`.
Note that local builds [lack version information](https://go.dev/issue/50603),
so you should inject the version string when building a release, such as:

	git switch -d v0.9.0
	go install -ldflags='-X cuelang.org/go/cmd/cue/cmd.version=v0.9.0' ./cmd/cue

### Learning CUE

The fastest way to learn the basics is to follow the [tour on the website](https://cuelang.org/docs/tour/).

More documentation including various tutorials can be found [on the website](https://cuelang.org/docs/).

### Go release support policy

As a general rule, we support the two most recent major releases of Go,
matching Go's [security policy](https://go.dev/doc/security/policy).
For example, if CUE v0.7.0 is released when Go's latest version is 1.21.5,
v0.7.x including any following bugfix releases will require Go 1.20 or later.
