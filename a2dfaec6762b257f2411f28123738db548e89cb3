      "message": "This seems like too much of a breaking change to me. It seems entirely likely to me that people are using CUE to decode into an interface and then using a dynamic type conversion or type switch that only accepts either `int` or `*big.Int`.\n\nTo avoid that breakage, I think it would be better to continue to return `int` when the result is within int bounds and otherwise return `*big.Int`. Depending on how that\u0027s done, it might be a bit less efficient on a 32 bit platform when returning values that are between `int` and `int64`, but I think that\u0027s better than a breaking change where we get no help from the compiler.",
