      "message": "Interesting that this gets reported as `fatalChild.0` because it\u0027s not actually correct. Instead it\u0027s the 0th element of first argument to the builtin whose value we are trying to assign to the x field in `fatalChild`. I guess this falls into the category of \"better error messages\" later, and outside the scope of this change.",
