Maybe this description could explain how those two things are linked?",

      "message": "I misread this at first as being about when IsInline is calculated, not what it meant... My fault, but maybe:\n\n// IsInline signifies whether this struct is computed as part of an expression ... etc.\n\nmight be clearer.\n\nFWIW after thinking about the meaning for a little bit, I\u0027m not entirely convinced that \"IsInline\" is a great choice of word, as in a sense, these expressions are _not_ inline; that is, they\u0027re not represented as part of a line of source code but calculated on the fly. That said, I haven\u0027t thought of a great alternative: IsResult? IsSynthesized? IsAllocated? IsSource (with the other sense) ?",
