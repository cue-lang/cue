We should have a generic interface like \"Decorator\" in cue/context and then a separate package that includes wasm.\n\nI know the linker should drop this when not used, but it nonetheless seems to set the wrong precedence. \n\nThe cue package is supposed to be light weight.",

      "message": "Perhaps I misunderstood the word \"generic\".\n\nI did start with injecting Wasm through cue/context, as we discussed, but it soon became apparent the functionality provided by cuecontext.Option is not the right functionality we need. In particular, those options become runtime options and we need Wasm functionality at built time (for some notion of build time). To be more concrete, we need access to the Wasm runtime at the moment we create an adt.Builtin, and we do not have a runtime at that point. Nor do we need access to the Wasm runtime in the runtime at all.\n\nI did consider changing what a cuecontext.Option could do, such that it could perhaps create default build options, but that seemed very invasive and magic, and opened up questions about what happens when the user supplies build options both via the context mechanism, so I decided against.",

It takes some syntactical representation of a Wasm declaration (here through an attribute, but see below) and converts it to what is required for the evaluator to use it (an adt.Builtin).\n\nWhen we will have actual function signatures in native CUE, having Wasm here will fit the model even better.
