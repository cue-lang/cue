I think not, just like you have it here, as setting Registry explicitly seems like enough of an opt-in signal to me. Perhaps briefly mention this assumption.",

      "message": "Big +1 to the different method names now. I like these better. The only nit I have is that ResolveToHost returning a Location feels odd - it should either return a Host, or be called ResolveToLocation. Particularly since you do have a Host type in this same package, so it\u0027s somewhat misleading.\n\nThe same could be said about HostResolver - perhaps name it LocationResolver.",

      "message": "I really don\u0027t know what the convention here is, but do we need to document that `cfg0`, if non nil, will be copied instead of modified? A pointer argument suggests two things to my mind: 1) I don\u0027t need to provide anything but also 2) what I provide could be modified. It feels like we need to explicitly state that we will copy `cfg0` is non-nil and never modify it. Same for `NewRegistry` below. But I defer to you and @mvdan@mvdan.cc for what is convention with such args.",
