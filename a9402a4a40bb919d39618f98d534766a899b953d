      "message": "do we want to error if `!cueexperiment.Flags.Modules \u0026\u0026 c.Registry !\u003d nil`, for the sake of saying \"you set up a registry, but did not enable the modules experiment\"? I think not, just like you have it here, as setting Registry explicitly seems like enough of an opt-in signal to me. Perhaps briefly mention this assumption.",

      "message": "Big +1 to the different method names now. I like these better. The only nit I have is that ResolveToHost returning a Location feels odd - it should either return a Host, or be called ResolveToLocation. Particularly since you do have a Host type in this same package, so it\u0027s somewhat misleading.\n\nThe same could be said about HostResolver - perhaps name it LocationResolver.",
