      "message": "Hmm. I wonder which error messages those might be. When there are no imports containing a major version suffix (which there shouldn\u0027t be in this kind of situation) and there are no dependencies, I\u0027m not sure that any messages will mention the full module path.\n\nNote that what we\u0027ll get here is exactly the same as if the module file had a language version but no major version suffix on the module path. That behaviour seems to be OK, so I\u0027m not sure this is any different.",
