      "message": "To reiterate online discussion:\n\nIn general, `diff/todo/pX` doesn\u0027t say which diff the TODO applies to, to take one example, in https://review.gerrithub.io/c/cue-lang/cue/+/1223893/2/cue/testdata/basicrewrite/010_lists.txtar we have `out/def` which has no diffs and `out/eval` which does, so when the `def` test executes, it sees that there are no diffs (for def itself) and decides to remove the `diff/todo/p3` file. That\u0027s why it seemed better to me to remove the `diff/todo` file only when there are no `diff/*` entries at all, and similarly for `diff/*/explanation`.",
