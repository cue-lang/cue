      "message": "Nice thought. I added a test case to the previous CL; the existing behavior is `number \u0026 0123`, which is broken, as `0123` is not a valid CUE integer literal.\n\nThe new behavior as of PS1 is indeed stringifying as `\"0123\"`, and I agree it\u0027s not great, but at least it\u0027s not invalid CUE, so it\u0027s not strictly any worse.\n\nThat said, I have tweaked the octal logic to not kick in when there is an explicit tag, because I didn\u0027t mean to change this other broken edge case. We can deal with this edge case of yours separately, via the TODO reminder I\u0027ve added for myself.",
