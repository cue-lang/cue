      "message": "yeah, I can see your point. this name was borrowed from Go, much like the rest of the API. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a perfect name, but it\u0027s OK for now.\n\n\nin the years since, Go has sort of standardized around an IsZero method for encodings. we could possibly use that here, but \"is not zero\" is not significantly clear than \"is valid\" or \"is not no pos\" IMHO.",
