      "message": "FYI Paul, Marcel mentioned that he used to turn on CUE_DEBUG for pre-releases, turning it off before the final release. It would help spot any potential bugs via the assertions while users tested the pre-releases.\n\nThat was a manual step that we\u0027ve been forgetting for a long time :) Hence my attempt at some automatic detection.\n\nAn alternative would be to always have assertions on by default. I feel like we should consider that separately, since turning on assertions by default in a stable release could lead to lots of user breakage.",
