      "message": "Roger mentioned last week that this isn\u0027t meant to be reviewed/merged, and that instead he\u0027ll repurpose this CL for a different change.\n\nNoting this here for our records. For the sake of clarity, I think it would be good to mark CLs as either \"work in progress\" or abandoned entirely, to make sure others aren\u0027t confused. It seems like I can abandon Roger\u0027s CL but not mark it as WIP, which is... interesting :)",
