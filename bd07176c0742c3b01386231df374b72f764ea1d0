      "message": "if the user _is_ doing something that requires a registry, an oci auth config load should be a fatal error and not a warning, though?\n\nin fact, registry_lazy_config further down shows that a bad config doesn\u0027t lead to a warning when cmd/cue doesn\u0027t need a registry, so IMO this warning below should always be a hard error.\n\nunless we want to make it a warning for the sake of falling back to some other default. which could be an okay approach, but then this comment isn\u0027t accurate, I think.",

      "message": "Yeah, I wondered about this. Technically it _might_ be OK to use a bad config file because it falls back to unauthenticated access which can succeed if no auth is required (that\u0027s why I left it as a warning) but I think it\u0027s fine to be a hard error too. Done.",
