      "message": "The cue binary grows by 5KiB, or 0.018%, so that\u0027s negligible. Not really concerned about that given how we just have two types here.\n\nI guess complexity is subjective. I find the newer APIs much easier to reason about; you\u0027re passing types as type parameters rather than as odd zero values. Sure, it\u0027s still reflection underneath, but that\u0027s fine - it\u0027s just a matter of being clear about what is the type parameter.\n\nIf you don\u0027t like this I can abandon - I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a big deal either way - but I do lean towards using type parameters for this because you are literally passing types around.",
