      "message": "Hi, thanks for your patch! Sorry for the confusion but I had already started working on this - you might see that #3339 has been assigned to me for a week. You didn\u0027t spend much time here I hope, and my work-in-progress patch is quite similar, so I\u0027ll take a look at whether to adapt yours or finish mine. But either way, it\u0027s best not to duplicate work :)",
