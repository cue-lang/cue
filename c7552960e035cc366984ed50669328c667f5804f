      "message": "Sorry, what do you mean? Yes, expiry may be zero if an access token never expires, even though in practice that will never appen. But if it does happen, the UTC and Truncate methods will maintain the IsZero()\u003d\u003dtrue property, so it will still work as a non-expiring token just fine. We don\u0027t want to round up to one second, because that would turn a token that never expires into a token that expires immediately.",

      "message": "After a Discord chat - you meant a non-zero expiry timestamp that\u0027s less than one second away. That could in theory happen, although in practice it won\u0027t, because such a token is useless unless it\u0027s valid for at least a handful of minutes.\n\nThe truncation might cause a super-short-lived token to expire in 0.0s rather than e.g. 0.9s, but that\u0027s still the same end result - the token expires immediately. So I won\u0027t add defensive code given that it\u0027s not a practical issue and that the added code doesn\u0027t seem worth it - and is hard to test.",
