      "message": "did you consider `type Schema \u003d cue.Value`? this should still work with pkg/gen.go as long as we use the new go/types alias tracking (opt-in in Go 1.22, opt-out in Go 1.23), and then it means fewer lines of code and less breakage for any Go users currently passing cue.Value to these exposed Go APIs. So I\u0027d definitely do it.\n\nI can help with those changes, it can be as a CL on top of your stack for example.",
