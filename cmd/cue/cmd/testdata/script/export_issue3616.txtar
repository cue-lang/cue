# The old evaluator (evalv2) does not correctly handle some combination of the
# scenario below, which involves "copying" values and the use of -l for a
# non-CUE file. The precise reason that evalv2 does not fail as expected is not
# known. But given we are close to switching to evalv3 by default, and all
# efforts and fixed are geared in that direction, adding this test to lock in
# the behaviour of evalv3 (and evalv2 for that matter) is deemed sufficient.
#
# evalv3 correctly fails.

# With evalv3, we get an error.
env CUE_EXPERIMENT=evalv3
! exec cue export --with-context -l '_input:' -l 'filename' x.cue data.json
stderr 'notAllowed: field not allowed'

# But with evalv2, it's incorrectly allowed. i.e. the following cue export
# command should fail (with the error message in the commented stderr
# expectation) but doesn't
env CUE_EXPERIMENT=
exec cue export --with-context -l '_input:' -l 'filename' x.cue data.json
# stderr 'notAllowed: field not allowed'
