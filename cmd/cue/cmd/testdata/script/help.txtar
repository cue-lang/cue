cue evaluates CUE files, an extension of JSON, and sends them
to user-defined commands for processing.

Commands are defined in CUE as follows:

	import "tool/exec"
	command: deploy: {
		exec.Run
		cmd:   "kubectl"
		args:  ["-f", "deploy"]
		in:    json.Encode(userValue) // encode the emitted configuration.
	}

cue can also combine the results of http or grpc request with the input
configuration for further processing. For more information on defining commands
run 'cue help cmd' or go to cuelang.org/pkg/cmd.

For more information on writing CUE configuration files see cuelang.org.
