# This test checks for forwards compatibility with modules developed
# using newer versions of CUE. It checks that:
#
# 1) Downstream consumption does not work, as we don't support the newer language spec version.
# 2) Upstream development does not work, as modifying cue.mod/module.cue or publishing
#    the module is not safe when we don't have or understand the schema it uses.
#
# TODO(mvdan): once we split up language.version from the schema version,
# cover scenarios where just one of them is too new,
# as we should allow downstream consumption when only the module schema version is too new.

# A module that was created with a language.version of v0.99.0 in the far future.

# TODO(mvdan): downstream consumption via cue.mod/*/ works when it should not,
# because we do not yet use language.version as a minimum for parsing or evaluating CUE.
cd ${WORK}/v0.99.0
exec cue export
stdout '"downstream": "hello from v0.99.0.example"'

# TODO(mvdan): test downstream consumption via a registry; note that _registry/ complains
# because it is unable to parse the module.cue file with a schema that is too new.

# Continue inside the module's own directory as if we had cloned it directly.
cd ${WORK}
mv v0.99.0/cue.mod/pkg/v0.99.0.example v0.99.0-downstream-direct
