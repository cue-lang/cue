# This test checks for forwards compatibility with modules developed
# using newer versions of CUE. It checks that:
#
# 1) Downstream consumption does not work, as we don't support the newer language spec version.
# 2) Upstream development does not work, as modifying cue.mod/module.cue or publishing
#    the module is not safe when we don't have or understand the schema it uses.
#
# TODO(mvdan): once we split up language.version from the schema version,
# cover scenarios where just one of them is too new,
# as we should allow downstream consumption when only the module schema version is too new.

# A module that was created with a language.version of ${CUE_LANGUAGE_VERSION_BUGFIX},
# which is like the current ${CUE_LANGUAGE_VERSION} but with a higher bugfix release.
# For example, if ${CUE_LANGUAGE_VERSION} is v0.10.0 or v0.10.5, ${CUE_LANGUAGE_VERSION_BUGFIX} is v0.10.99.
# Even though the language spec should not change in bugfix releases,
# we still treat the language version as a hard minimum following semver.
