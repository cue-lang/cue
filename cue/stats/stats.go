	// These counters account for several key operations.

	// Unifications counts the number of calls to adt.Unify
	Unifications int

	// Disjuncts indicates the number of total disjuncts processed as part
	// of a Unify operation. A unification with no | operator counts as a
	// single disjunct, so Disjuncts is always greater than or equal to the
	// number of Unifications.
	//
	// If Disjuncts is much larger than Unification, this may indicate room
	// for optimization. In particular, most practical uses of disjunctions
	// should allow for near-linear processing.
	Disjuncts int

	// Conjuncts is an estimate of the number of conjunctions processed during
	// the calls to Unify. This includes the conjuncts added in the compilation
	// phase as well as the derivative conjuncts inserted from other nodes
	// after following references.
	//
	// A number of Conjuncts much larger than Disjuncts may indicate non-linear
	// algorithmic behavior.
	Conjuncts int

	// Buffer counters
	//
	// Each unification and disjunct operation is associated with an object
	// with temporary buffers. Reuse of this buffer is critical for performance.
	// The following counters track this.

	Freed    int // Number of buffers returned to the free pool.
	Reused   int // Number of times a buffer is reused instead of allocated.
	Allocs   int // Total number of allocated buffer objects.
	Retained int // Number of times a buffer is retained upon finalization.
