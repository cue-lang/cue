// This is an experimental type and the contents may change without notice.
type Counts struct {
	// Note that we can't use the public [cuecontext.EvalVersion] type
	// as that would lead to an import cycle. We could use "int" but that's a bit odd.
	// There's no harm in referencing an internal type in practice, given that
	// the public type is a type alias for the internal type already.

	// EvalVersion is the evaluator version which was used for the CUE evaluation,
	// corresponding to one of the values under [cuelang.org/go/cue/cuecontext.EvalVersion].
	EvalVersion internal.EvaluatorVersion

	// Operation counters
	//
	// These counters account for several key operations.

	// Unifications counts the number of calls to adt.Unify
	Unifications int64

	// Disjuncts indicates the number of total disjuncts processed as part
	// of a Unify operation. A unification with no | operator counts as a
	// single disjunct, so Disjuncts is always greater than or equal to the
	// number of Unifications.
	//
	// If Disjuncts is much larger than Unification, this may indicate room
	// for optimization. In particular, most practical uses of disjunctions
	// should allow for near-linear processing.
	Disjuncts int64

	// Notifications counts how often a Vertex is added to the notification
	// queue. This is typically only the case when a Vertex is involved in
	// some kind of cycle, so this should be relatively low in practice
	// compared to the number of unifications.
	Notifications int64 // Number of notifications sent to nodes.

	// Conjuncts is an estimate of the number of conjunctions processed during
	// the calls to Unify. This includes the conjuncts added in the compilation
	// phase as well as the derivative conjuncts inserted from other nodes
	// after following references.
	//
	// A number of Conjuncts much larger than Disjuncts may indicate non-linear
	// algorithmic behavior.
	Conjuncts int64

	// Typo checking counters
	NumCloseIDs      int64 // Number of close IDs used
	ConjunctInfos    int64 // Number of conjunct infos created
	MaxConjunctInfos int64 // Maximum number of conjunct infos in a node
	MaxReqSets       int64 // Maximum number of requirement sets
	MaxRedirect      int64 // Maximum number of redirects in containsDefID

	// Exception counters
	//
	// These counters track exceptional conditions that occur during evaluation.

	// GenerationMismatch indicates the number of times a node was unified
	// with a different generation than the one it was created in.
	GenerationMismatch int64 // Number of exceptional unification cases

	// MisalignedConjunct indicates the number of conjuncts that were dropped
	// because they were not aligned with the current generation of the context.
	// Generally this happens because a previously finalized vertex is unified
	// in as a value, not constraint, in which case it is okay to ignore
	// closedness info. If it were included as a schema, top-level conjuncts
	// would be unified and mapped to a local tree.
	MisalignedConjunct int64

	// MisalignedConstraint indicates the number of constraints that were not
	// aligned. This is more likely to be a bug.
	MisalignedConstraint int64

	// SkippedNotification indicates the number of notifications that were
	// skipped because the value was already finalized. This may miss conjuncts
	// when it occurs during evaluation, but it may also be triggered during
	// dependency analysis, in which case it is benign.
	SkippedNotification int64

	// Buffer counters
	//
	// Each unification and disjunct operation is associated with an object
	// with temporary buffers. Reuse of this buffer is critical for performance.
	// The following counters track this.

	Freed    int64 // Number of buffers returned to the free pool.
	Reused   int64 // Number of times a buffer is reused instead of allocated.
	Allocs   int64 // Total number of allocated buffer objects.
	Retained int64 // Number of times a buffer is retained upon finalization.
}

// TODO: None of the methods below protect against overflows or underflows.
// If those start happening in practice, or if the counters get large enough,
// add checks on each of the operations.

			panic("the first call to Counts.Add must provide an evaluator version")

		c.EvalVersion = vo
	case v != vo:
		// Any further evaluator counts being added must match the same evaluator version.
		//
		// TODO(mvdan): this is currently not possible to enforce, as we collect stats globally
		// via [adt.AddStats] which includes stats from contexts created with different versions.
		// We likely need to refactor the collection of stats so that it is not global first.
