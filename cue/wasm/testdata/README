The .wasm files are not generated by `go generate`, because we don't
want to burden CUE developers with a Rust dependency. Rather, each
.rs file contains instructions on how to compile it to Wasm in its
header.

A better option might be to have `go generate` compile the rust
code conditional on some environment variable, but we don't have
that yet.
