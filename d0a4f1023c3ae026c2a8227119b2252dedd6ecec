      "message": "Maybe, but I\u0027m not convinced - the start job doesn\u0027t have a git checkout, and that alone is already in the order of seconds to run. And I want earlyChecks to also include other cheap and commonly-failing checks in the future, like gofmt - which will also need installGo. So I think it\u0027s nicer in the long term to have it here.",
