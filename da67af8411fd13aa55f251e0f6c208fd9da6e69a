      "message": "surely this is just `return expr, ok` without the if/else?\n\nthe untyped nil matters if you were doing a type assertion to a non-interface type, but here ast.Expr is an interface, so it\u0027s OK. I guess you could prefer the current form to be defensive against any chance of a typed nil pointer, but I think it\u0027s fine given that you\u0027re type asserting to the same type you return.",

      "message": "what does an empty pattern mean? I tried searching the existing jsonschema code, as well as a bit on google, but could not find an easy answer. if it means something special like \"all properties\", I\u0027d like to see a note about it somewhere in the code with an example like `patternProperties: \"\": type: \"integer\"`, as I could not find any.\n\n\nIf my guess above is correct - is this patternProperties not redundant with additionalProperties too? both enforce `type: \"integer\"` the same way. It sounds like we\u0027re being mildly wasteful here.",
