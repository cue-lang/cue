      "message": "This has gone back to a slice, because in `maybeAddCompletion`, we need to \"make progress\" to avoid an infinite loop. This means that e.g. for a structlit, we need to start the new astNode with just the elements of structlit and not the structlit itself, so that we don\u0027t loop, calling `maybeAddCompletion`. Making this change causes `newAstNode` and associated methods to have their args swapped around so the last arg can become variadic.",
