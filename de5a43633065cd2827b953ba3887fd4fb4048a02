      "message": "This appears to do a lot of work, only to leave 90% of it on the floor, which will likely increase init-time costs for most use cases where it has no benefit.\n\nWhy not make `fileForExt` a sync map with a `sync.Once` value that returns the `*build.File`? Then we get the benefit for all extensions in a lazy manner.",

      "message": "I thought about doing that, and even started implementing it that way, but accessing via sync.Map has its own cost (at least an allocation on every access due to the string-\u003einterface conversion), it makes everything a little bit more complex, and in the end the extra cost is quite small: the old init function takes about 6442µs to execute; the new one 6979µs, an additional cost of ~10% (536µs) that\u0027s paid once only.\n\nIn the future, it would be nice to remove the runtime CUE evaluation entirely, perhaps relying a preprocessor and `go generate`, to reduce the init time cost to near zero, but I think this is OK for now. Note that this whole thing is _already_ lazy to a degree, so if the program doesn\u0027t actually invoke `cue/load`, we won\u0027t pay this cost.",
