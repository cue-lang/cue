## Install CUE from source

### Prerequisites

Go 1.18 or higher (see below)

### Installing CUE

<!-- Keep the following in sync with cmd/cue/cmd/testdata/script/install*.txtar -->

To download and install the `cue` command line tool, run:

```
go install cuelang.org/go/cmd/cue@latest
```

To also download the API and documentation, run:

```
go get cuelang.org/go/cue@latest
```

in a module context.


### Installing Go

#### Download Go

You can install binaries for Windows, MacOS X, and Linux at https://golang.org/dl/. If you use a different OS you can
[install Go from source](https://golang.org/doc/install/source).

#### Install Go

Follow the instructions at https://golang.org/doc/install#install.
Make sure the `go` binary is in your path.
CUE uses Go modules, so there is no need to set up a GOPATH.
