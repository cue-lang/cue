      "message": "It looks like this change has somehow exposed a bug: this should really be referring to `foo.self` because `foo.bar` does not actually exist. As this test is definitely not oriented towards finding evaluator errors, I\u0027d suggest fixing this in an earlier CL to use `foo.self` (ideally it would be good to find out _why_ the `foo.bar` reference was not resulting in an error previously, but it\u0027s not _that_ important, given that it\u0027s fixed in evalv3).\n\nThe `TODO why does this succeed` comment should still be legitimate, as none of that behaviour has changed AFAIK.",
