When a user runs `cue version`, they are primarily interested in the version of the software, not the version of the language spec it uses.\n\nI also don\u0027t think \"build version\" is clear enough, as it doesn\u0027t mean that much on its own. how about:\n\n```\ncue version %s\ncue language version %s\ngo version %s\n```\n\nI honestly think \"cue version\" on the first line is enough, as \"cue language version\" is then clearly separate.",

The main point of the user agent string is literally to tell the server what version the client software is running, to e.g. work around old client bugs or to know when the client is new enough to handle new kinds of responses.\n\nMoreover, the user-agent syntax is like \"\u003cproduct\u003e / \u003cproduct-version\u003e\". The latest pre-release we have right now has a \"product version\" of v0.9.0-alpha.3, not v0.9.0. If anything, the language version is the extra string that should go later as a comment.",
