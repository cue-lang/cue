      "message": "Cool, only one thought: there are a couple of places only where the optional `o` is being used - as in 0o666. According to https://go.dev/ref/spec#Integer_literals that `o` is optional, and the vast majority of cases it\u0027s not used, so as you\u0027re here, it might be worth removing it so they\u0027re all the same.",

      "message": "The `0o` form was added later on in Go for consistency and readability - we now have `0b` and `0x`, so `0o` is nicer than `0`. So I would suggest the opposite - that we transition to `0o`. I didn\u0027t do this here to avoid the noise, but gofumpt does it :)",
