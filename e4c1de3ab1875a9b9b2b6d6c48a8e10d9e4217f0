      "message": "SGTM in general but this basically repeats 2/3rds of what is already explained in `cue help inputs`, so the duplication is going to lead to discrepancies and confusion.\n\nI think those two sections should be joined and shortened to just one paragraph, saying e.g. \"see `cue help inputs` for more\".",

      "message": "I\u0027ve done this, but I disagree about duplication being a problem if the aim of the help text is to assist newcomers. A lack of duplication (instead preferring  pointers to other docs) eases the documentation maintenance burden only by outsourcing that cost to each reader; who must take the additional step of following those links, mentally recombine the information, and synthesise it into the correct result for the individual command they\u0027re trying to understand.\n\nIMHO a lack of duplication is fine in reference material, where avoiding inconsistencies via single-sources-of-truth is paramount; but it\u0027s either neutral or negative when a text\u0027s readership includes any significant amount of less technical folks, or newcomers. I believe that the `cue help \u003ccommand\u003e` texts should primarily meet their need of understanding `\u003ccommand\u003e`, and shouldn\u0027t be written or considered as reference material ... but that\u0027s just my personal view ðŸ™‚",
