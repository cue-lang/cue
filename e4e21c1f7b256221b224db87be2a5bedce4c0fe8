      "message": "So we\u0027re OK with stabilizing all the modules CLI, including subcommands and flags and their behavior?\n\nI think it\u0027s fine, as nothing sticks out in terms of being a bad design, but I thought we would remove the mentions of CUE_EXPERIMENT\u003dmodules and slowly remove the \"EXPERIMENTAL\" note on the CLI design over the coming weeks as we gain confidence that it works well for users - particularly after v0.9 once they get decently broad use.",

      "message": "That\u0027s a fair point. How about this as a middle ground: move the warning to the bottom of each command, to slightly de-emphasise it, and changing the wording to something like \"warning: CLI is not yet stable\"?\n\nThe main concern I had looking at the docs is that it still appeared like modules was experimental: all the key commands had big warnings at the top of them.",
