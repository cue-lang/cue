      "message": "Indeed it won\u0027t work on the playground. I thought about this while I was writing the example, but forgot to make a note of it or rethink it.\n\ncue/load doesn\u0027t support io/fs, and using an Overlay would make the example rather complex and not really reflect what most users will want to do. So I think the only way to make it work on the playground would be to use os.MkdirTemp to create go.mod and example.cue files by hand.\n\nThe alternative would be to leave as-is and make a note that the example works when run locally, but not on pkgsite. I still think the example is useful on its own even in this semi-broken state, e.g. https://pkg.go.dev/cuelang.org/go/cue/parser#example-ParseFile still shows you the expected output before you run it, and we still test the example as part of CI.\n\nI lean towards the first option but I\u0027m not sure given the extra boilerplate. Thoughts?",
