      "message": "I would do this as part of the same astutil.Apply, and make the switch on n.Op have two cases. It will save you a few lines of code, but most importantly, it means you only walk the entire syntax tree once for this fix, rather than twice. Given how similar the two rewrites are, I think it\u0027s worth it.\n\nI think you can even reuse much of the code that does the rewrite itself. The only difference between the two is the name of the function.",
