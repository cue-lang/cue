      "message": "I played around with this, and I\u0027m pretty sure that we\u0027ll need two separate caches:\n - one for abs file path -\u003e ast files\n - one for abs dir -\u003e build files\n\nSince in l.addFiles we\u0027re looping over a []*build.File, a cache keyed by dir would become awkward and inefficient. Intuitively I thought that the syntax could be added right after a *build.File is added to the package, but that breaks everything - it looks like (at least atm) the syntax adding must happen at the end of the *build.Instance loading phase.\n\nPlease let me know if I\u0027m missing something basic",
