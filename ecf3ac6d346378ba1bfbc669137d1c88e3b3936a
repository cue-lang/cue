      "message": "TBH, I\u0027m a little surprised by this. Although I completely agree that the previous semantics of Before are unsafe, and that Compare is the only safe thing to use, the fix here is nevertheless a breaking change IMO. I honestly don\u0027t see much difference between correcting the behaviour of Before, as you have done here, and just removing it altogether (in fact, I would argue that removing it is the safer thing to do).",
