      "message": "I don\u0027t like this because it breaks the algorithm for calculating strongly connected components.\n\nAs the comment says, the sccNodeState is temporary - it is valid only during the calculation of the SCCs. My reading of this change is that these nodes now become permanent. This means that if you calculate the SCCs, then change the graph, and then recalculate the SCCs, then you\u0027ll be mixing up nodes and most likely get the wrong results. I.e. the scc nodes capture the current state of graph, and they can\u0027t be reused.\n\nIf you really want to do this, I\u0027d want to see the API for the graph in general modified so that attempting to modify the graph after the SCCs have been calculated leads to probably a panic, but at minimum an error.",
