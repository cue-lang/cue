      "message": "@Paul @Daniel I\u0027d be interested to see a /working/ setup, with a single Gerrit SSH origin, using insteadOf to allow git-codereview to work!\n\nI couldn\u0027t get this working with /any/ combination of protocol, username, port or host placed inside git config\u0027s `url`\u0027s `insteadOf` setting, or the url selector. This is where I ended up, and it still didn\u0027t work:\n\n```\n[url \"https://jpluscplusm@review.gerrithub.io/a\"]\n  insteadOf \u003d ssh://jpluscplusm@review.gerrithub.io:29418\n```\n\nDigging into the code I see this, at https://cs.opensource.google/go/x/review/+/master:git-codereview/api.go;l\u003d62 ...\n\n```\noriginUrl :\u003d trim(cmdOutput(\"git\", \"config\", \"remote.origin.url\"))\n```\n\nMy reading is that git-codereview compares the  the remote\u0027s configured URL which, in the case of an SSH origin, is `ssh://...`. Critically, AFAICT, the command `git config remote.origin.url` doesn\u0027t return the \"munged-through-url.insteadOf\" value.\n\nI can\u0027t see how to make this work, especially in a way which invalidates the currently documented \"don\u0027t use SSH with GerritHub\" guidance - so if anyone has a known-good setup with a single Gerrit SSH origin that they could share, I\u0027ll happily document it!",
