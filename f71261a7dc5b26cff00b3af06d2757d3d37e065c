      "message": "Yeah, this is always going to be somewhat lossy given how Cobra allows you to put flags before subcommand names. Given unknown flags, it has to guess that they take an argument. But I think this new mechanism is slightly better overall.\n\nIf/when cobra implements https://github.com/spf13/cobra/issues/706, then perhaps we can do away with some of this hackery.",
