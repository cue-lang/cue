// The evict_caches removes "old" GitHub actions caches from the main repo and
// the accompanying trybot repo. The job is only run in the main repo, because
// that is the only place where the credentials exist.
//
// The GitHub actions caches in the main and trybot repos can get large. So
// large in fact we got the following warning from GitHub:
//
//   "Approaching total cache storage limit (34.5 GB of 10 GB Used)"
//
// Yes, you did read that right.
//
// Not only does this have the effect of causing us to breach "limits" it also
// means that we can't be sure that individual caches are not bloated.
//
// Fix that by purging the actions caches on a daily basis at 0200, followed 15
// mins later by a re-run of the tip trybots to repopulate the caches so they
// are warm and minimal.
//
// In testing with @mvdan, this resulted in cache sizes for Linux dropping from
// ~1GB to ~125MB. This is a considerable saving.
