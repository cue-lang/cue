// package github declares the workflows for this project.
package github

// Note: the name of the workflows (and hence the corresponding .yml filenames)
// correspond to the environment variable names for gerritstatusupdater.
// Therefore, this filename must only be change in combination with also
// updating the environment in which gerritstatusupdater is running for this
// repository.
//
// This name is also used by the CI badge in the top-level README.
//
// This name is also used in the evict_caches lookups.
//
// i.e. don't change the names of workflows!
//
// In addition to separately declaring the workflows themselves, we define the
// shape of #workflows here as a cross-check that we don't accidentally change
// the name of workflows without reading this comment.
//
// We explicitly use close() here instead of a definition in order that we can
// cue export the github package as a test.
workflows: close({
	// Adding this constraint here, whilst clear for the reader,
	// blows out evaluation time. This will be fixed as part of
	// the performance work which is covered under various issues.
