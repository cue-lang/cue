// zeroReleaseTagSuffix is the suffix used to identify all "zero" releases.
// When we create a release branch for v0.$X.0, it's likely that commits on the
// default branch will from that point onwards be intended for the $X+1
// version. However, unless we tag the next commit after the release branch, it
// might be the case that pseudo versions of those later commits refer to the
// $X release.

// branch. Critically, the -0.dev pre-release suffix is ordered before -alpha.
