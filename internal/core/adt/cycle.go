// Cycle detection:
//
// - Current algorithm does not allow for early non-cyclic conjunct detection.
// - Record possibly cyclic references.
// - Mark as cyclic if no evidence is found.
// - Note that this also activates the same reference in other (parent) conjuncts.

// CYCLE DETECTION ALGORITHM
//
// BACKGROUND
//
// The cycle detection is inspired by the cycle detection used by Tomabechi's
// [Tomabechi COLING 1992] and Van Lohuizen's [Van Lohuizen ACL 2000] graph
// unification algorithms.
//
// Unlike with traditional graph unification, however, CUE uses references,
// which, unlike node equivalence, are unidirectional. This means that the
// technique to track equivalence through dereference, as common in graph
// unification algorithms like Tomabechi's, does not work unaltered.
//
// The unidirectional nature of references imply that each reference equates a
// facsimile of the value it points to. This renders the original approach of
// node-pointer equivalence useless.
//
//
// PRINCIPLE OF ALGORITHM
//
// The solution for CUE is based on two observations:
//
// - the CUE algorithm tracks all conjuncts that define a node separately, -
// accumulating used references on a per-conjunct basis causes duplicate
//   references to uniquely identify cycles.
//
// A structural cycle, as defined by the spec, can then be detected if all
// conjuncts are marked as a cycle.
//
// References are accumulated as follows:
//
// 1. If a conjunct is a reference the reference is associated with that
//    conjunct as well as the conjunct corresponding to the value it refers to.
// 2. If a conjunct is a struct (including lists), its references are associated
//    with all embedded values and fields.
//
// To narrow down the specifics of the reference-based cycle detection, let us
// explore structural cycles in a bit more detail.
//
//
// STRUCTURAL CYCLES
//
// See the language specification for a higher-level and more complete overview.
//
// We have to define when a cycle is detected. CUE implementations MUST report
// an error upon a structural cycle, and SHOULD report cycles at the shortest
// possible paths at which they occur, but MAY report these at deeper paths. For
// instance, the following CUE has a structural cycle
//
//     f: g: f
//
// The shortest path at which the cycle can be reported is f.g, but as all
// failed configurations are logically equal, it is fine for implementations to
// report them at f.g.g, for instance.
//
// It is not, however, correct to assume that a reference to a parent is always
// a cycle. Consider this case:
//
//     a: [string]: b: a
//
// Even though reference `a` refers to a parent node, the cycle needs to be fed
// by a concrete field in struct `a` to persist, meaning it cannot result in a
// cycle as defined in the spec as it is defined here. Note however, that a
// specialization of this configuration _can_ result in a cycle. Consider
//
//     a: [string]: b: a
//     a: c: _
//
// Here reference `a` is guaranteed to result in a structural cycle, as field
// `c` will match the pattern constraint unconditionally.
//
// In other words, it is not possible to exclude tracking references across
// pattern constraints from cycle checking.
//
// It is tempting to try to find a complete set of these edge cases with the aim
// to statically determine cases in which this occurs. But as [Carpenter 1992]
// demonstrates, it is possible for cycles to be created as a result of unifying
// two graphs that are themselves acyclic. The following example is a
// translation of Carpenters example to CUE:
//
//     y: {
//         f: h: g
//         g: _
//     }
//     x: {
//         f: _
//         g: f
//     }
//
// Even though the above contains no cycles, the result of `x & y` is cyclic:
//
//     f: h: g
//     g: f
//
// This means that, in practice, cycle detection has at least partially a
// dynamic component to it.
//
//
// ABSTRACT ALGORITHM
//
// The algorithm is described declaratively by defining what it means for a
// field to have a structural cycle. In the below, a _reference_ is uniquely
// identified by the pointer identity of a Go Resolver instance.
//
// Cycles are tracked on a per-conjunct basis and are not aggregated per Vertex:
// administrative information is only passed on from parent to child conjunct.
//
// A conjunct is a _parent_ of another conjunct if is a conjunct of one of the
// non-optional fields of the conjunct. For instance, conjunct `x` with value
// `{b: y & z}`, is a parent of conjunct `y` as well as `z`. Within field `b`,
// the conjuncts `y` and `z` would be tracked individually, though.
//
// A conjunct is _associated with a reference_ if its value was obtained by
// evaluating a reference. Note that a conjunct may be associated with many
// references if its evaluation requires evaluating a chain of references. For
// instance, consider
//
//    a: {x: d}
//    b: a
//    c: b & e
//    d: y: 1
//
// the first conjunct of field `c` (reference `b`) has the value `{x: y: 1}` and
// is associated with references `b` and `a`.
//
// The _tracked references_ of a conjunct are all references that are associated
// with it or any of its ancestors (parents of parents). For instance, the
// tracked references of conjunct `b.x` of field `c.x` are `a`, `b`, and `d`.
//
// A conjunct is a violating cycle if it is a reference that:
//  - occurs in the tracked references of the conjunct, or
//  - directly refers to a parent node of the conjunct.
//
// A conjunct is cyclic if it is a violating cycle or if any of its ancestors
// are a violating cycle.
//
// A field has a structural cycle if it is composed of at least one conjunct
// that is a violating cycle and no conjunct that is not cyclic.
//
// Note that a field can be composed of only cyclic conjuncts while still not be
// structural cycle: as long as there are no conjuncts that are a violating
// cycle, it is not a structural cycle. This is important for the following
//     case:
//
//         a: [string]: b: a
//         x: a
//         x: c: b: c: {}
//
// Here, reference `a` is never a cycle as the recursive references crosses a
// pattern constraint that only instantiates if it is unified with something
// else.
//
//
// DISCUSSION
//
// The goal of conjunct cycle marking algorithm is twofold: - mark conjuncts
// that are proven to propagate indefinitely - mark them as early as possible
// (shortest CUE path).
//
// TODO: Prove all cyclic conjuncts will eventually be marked as cyclic.
//
// TODO:
//   - reference marks whether it crosses a pattern, improving the case
//     a: [string]: b: c: b
//     This requires a compile-time detection mechanism.
