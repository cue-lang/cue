// These are the condition types of the CUE evaluator. A scheduler

//
// There are core conditions and condition sets. The core conditions are
// determined during operation as conditions are met. The condition sets are
// used to indicate a set of required or provided conditions.
//
// Core conditions can be signal conditions or counter conditions. A counter
// condition is triggered if all conjuncts that contribute to the computation
// of this condition have been met. A signal condition is triggered as soon as
// evidence is found that this condition is met. Unless otherwise specified,
// conditions are counter conditions.
