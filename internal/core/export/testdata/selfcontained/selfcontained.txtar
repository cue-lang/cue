#path: a.b

TODO: alternatives to consider
- `b.s` rewrites to `s` here. But we could interpret this as
   a "closed" value and write string instead. So

	s: string
	t: string

	or

	s: string
	t: _s
	_s: string

   Theoretically this seems more appropriate. It just may not be
   what users expect. Note that `t: s` would still remain `t: s`,
   as that reference does not refer to a node outside the closed
   node.
