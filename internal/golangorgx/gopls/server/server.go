	// # Modification tracking and diagnostics
	//
	// For the purpose of tracking diagnostics, we need a monotonically
	// increasing clock. Each time a change occurs on the server, this clock is
	// incremented and the previous diagnostics pass is cancelled. When the
	// changed is processed, the Session (via DidModifyFiles) determines which
	// Views are affected by the change and these views are added to the
	// viewsToDiagnose set. Then the server calls diagnoseChangedViews
	// in a separate goroutine. Any Views that successfully complete their
	// diagnostics are removed from the viewsToDiagnose set, provided they haven't
	// been subsequently marked for re-diagnosis (as determined by the latest
	// modificationID referenced by viewsToDiagnose).
	//
	// In this way, we enforce eventual completeness of the diagnostic set: any
	// views requiring diagnosis are diagnosed, though possibly at a later point
	// in time. Notably, the logic in Session.DidModifyFiles to determines if a
	// view needs diagnosis considers whether any packages in the view were
	// invalidated. Consider the following sequence of snapshots for a given view
	// V:
	//
	//     C1    C2
	//  S1 -> S2 -> S3
	//
	// In this case, suppose that S1 was fully type checked, and then two changes
	// C1 and C2 occur in rapid succession, to a file in their package graph but
	// perhaps not enclosed by V's root.  In this case, the logic of
	// DidModifyFiles will detect that V needs to be reloaded following C1. In
	// order for our eventual consistency to be sound, we need to avoid the race
	// where S2 is being diagnosed, C2 arrives, and S3 is not detected as needing
	// diagnosis because the relevant package has not yet been computed in S2. To
	// achieve this, we only remove V from viewsToDiagnose if the diagnosis of S2
	// completes before C2 is processed, which we can confirm by checking
	// S2.BackgroundContext().
