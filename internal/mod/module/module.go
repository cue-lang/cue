// Package module defines the module.Version type along with support code.
//
// The module.Version type is a simple Path, Version pair:
//
//	type Version struct {
//		Path string
//		Version string
//	}
//
// There are no restrictions imposed directly by use of this structure,
// but additional checking functions, most notably Check, verify that
// a particular path, version pair is valid.
//
// # Escaped Paths
//
// Module paths appear as substrings of file system paths
// (in the download cache) and of web server URLs in the proxy protocol.
// In general we cannot rely on file systems to be case-sensitive,
// nor can we rely on web servers, since they read from file systems.
// That is, we cannot rely on the file system to keep rsc.io/QUOTE
// and rsc.io/quote separate. Windows and macOS don't.
// Instead, we must never require two different casings of a file path.
// Because we want the download cache to match the proxy protocol,
// and because we want the proxy protocol to be possible to serve
// from a tree of static files (which might be stored on a case-insensitive
// file system), the proxy protocol must never require two different casings
// of a URL path either.
//
// One possibility would be to make the escaped form be the lowercase
// hexadecimal encoding of the actual path bytes. This would avoid ever
// needing different casings of a file path, but it would be fairly illegible
// to most programmers when those paths appeared in the file system
// (including in file paths in compiler errors and stack traces)
// in web server logs, and so on. Instead, we want a safe escaped form that
// leaves most paths unaltered.
//
// The safe escaped form is to replace every uppercase letter
// with an exclamation mark followed by the letter's lowercase equivalent.
//
// For example,
//
//	github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go ->  github.com/!azure/azure-sdk-for-go.
//	github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloudsql-proxy -> github.com/!google!cloud!platform/cloudsql-proxy
//	github.com/Sirupsen/logrus -> github.com/!sirupsen/logrus.
//
// Import paths that avoid upper-case letters are left unchanged.
// Note that because import paths are ASCII-only and avoid various
// problematic punctuation (like : < and >), the escaped form is also ASCII-only
// and avoids the same problematic punctuation.
//
// Import paths have never allowed exclamation marks, so there is no
// need to define how to escape a literal !.
//
// # Unicode Restrictions
//
// Today, paths are disallowed from using Unicode.
//
// Although paths are currently disallowed from using Unicode,
// we would like at some point to allow Unicode letters as well, to assume that
// file systems and URLs are Unicode-safe (storing UTF-8), and apply
// the !-for-uppercase convention for escaping them in the file system.
// But there are at least two subtle considerations.
//
// First, note that not all case-fold equivalent distinct runes
// form an upper/lower pair.
// For example, U+004B ('K'), U+006B ('k'), and U+212A ('K' for Kelvin)
// are three distinct runes that case-fold to each other.
// When we do add Unicode letters, we must not assume that upper/lower
// are the only case-equivalent pairs.
// Perhaps the Kelvin symbol would be disallowed entirely, for example.
// Or perhaps it would escape as "!!k", or perhaps as "(212A)".
//
// Second, it would be nice to allow Unicode marks as well as letters,
// but marks include combining marks, and then we must deal not
// only with case folding but also normalization: both U+00E9 ('é')
// and U+0065 U+0301 ('e' followed by combining acute accent)
// look the same on the page and are treated by some file systems
// as the same path. If we do allow Unicode marks in paths, there
// must be some kind of normalization to allow only one canonical
// encoding of any character used in an import path.

// IMPORTANT NOTE
//
// This file essentially defines the set of valid import paths for the go command.
// There are many subtle considerations, including Unicode ambiguity,
// security, network, and file system representations.
//
// This file also defines the set of valid module path and version combinations,
// another topic with many subtle considerations.
//
// Changes to the semantics in this file require approval from rsc.
