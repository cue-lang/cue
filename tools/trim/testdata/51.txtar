Demonstration of dependencies of references. Within b.c we find the
reference to x; we resolve that to a vertex which contains conjuncts
from line 1 and and line 4. We spot that line 4 is in the same (or
ancestor) lexical scope as b.c, and so we ensure that if line 5
survives, then line 4 must too, otherwise c: x will reference an
unknown field.
