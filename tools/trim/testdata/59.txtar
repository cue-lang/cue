Demonstration that embeddings need to be treated specially. The
reference x does not appear in the vertex for z. Without special
treatment of embeddings, we would attempt to simplify z to `z: _`.

-- a.cue --
x: y: 5
z: {
	x
}
-- out/trim --
== a.cue
x: y: 5
z: {
	x
}
-- out/trim-v3 --
== a.cue
x: y: 5
z: {
	x
}
